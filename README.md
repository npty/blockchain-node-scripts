# Blockchain Node Scripts

This repo contains a set of shell scripts to run blockchain node for supported projects.

These features are supported:

- Create the Google Cloud Compute Engine instance which matched with system requirement of the project
- Create the firewall rule for the instance to allow required ports.
- Install dependencies, setup environment variables, clone the project and build a binary.
- Create a systemd service so you can disconnect without stopping the node.
- Run and enjoy ðŸš€

This tool is made to supported people interested to run node quickly without having to read the project documentation.

Unfortunately, I'm not expected to maintain it in the long run especially when my interests drops.

So if that happens and you want to continue the development, don't hesitate to fork it and contact [me](nptytn2@gmail.com) to put a link to your forked project in README.

Enjoys ðŸ™‚

The supported projects are:

- [Moonbeam](https://github.com/npty/blockchain-node-scripts/tree/master/moonbeam)
- [Spacemesh](https://github.com/npty/blockchain-node-scripts/tree/master/spacemesh)
